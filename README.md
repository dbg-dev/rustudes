# Rustudes

"An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." — Wikipedia

This project contains pytudes—Python programs, usually short, for perfecting particular programming skills.

A project for a playing (and learning) with little Rust-based projects. It is inspired by Peter Norvig's (pytudes)[https://github.com/norvig/pytudes] project.
